### Introduction

Crin protocol - the decentralized and automated insured capital protocol for crypto insurance. Crin allows everyone to issue insurance coverage to cover any ERC-20 token pair X/Y in a few seconds. Investors can recover the loss of investment when the token price goes down and the insurer can receive premiums as a reward for supplying insurance capital.
