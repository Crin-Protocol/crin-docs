### Introduction
Crin protocol is a decentralized and automated protocol in the area of Crypto Insurance. Crin allows anyone who holds the token X to create Insurance Coverage packages to give insurance for the Y token. In case the the price of Y/X declines, investors who hold token Y will benefit from the insurance to reduce their risk of financial loss. The insurance creator will be compensated with premiums for raising insurance funds.
<br/>
Crin is the first protocol to build Automated Insured Capital (AIC) into Crypto Insurance allowing anyone to create insurance units. This is also Crin's biggest difference from the competition, where other competitors are using manual review mechanisms and DAOs to create and resolve insurance issues.
